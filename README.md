D&amp;D 4e Tracker for encounters

This is just a side project excuse to learn more about nuxt.js and all that relates to that. 
I have been really enjoying developing in vue.js components so nuxt.js was an easy choice. :)

You can see the 1.0.0 release of this at [encounter-tracker.jakea.net](http://encounter-tracker.jakea.net).

Now that I have a useful tool, I'm taking the next steps to make the user experience more palatable using [vuetify](https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify)!

Stay tuned!
